DesGroseilliers, Registered Dietitian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to losing weight, there\u2019s no miracle recipe or magic food that melts fat. So, to reach and maintain a healthy weight, you have to change your daily habits\u2026for life! It takes a little effort, time, and perseverance. Simply by moving a little more every day and by trying some of the meal ideas below, you may not only slim your waistline, but you\u2019ll improve your health and daily vitality.\n\n\n\n\nIdeas to lighten up your meals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace the ground beef in your spaghetti sauce with lentils. It\u2019s a great trick to reduce fat content and calories, while increasing fibre, a natural appetite suppressant.\n\n\nOn pizza and for other dishes using melted cheese, mix full-fat cheese with low-fat cheese, or mix it with firm shredded tofu instead. No one will be able to tell the difference! And to make the meal even more low-fat and nutritious, double the quantity of vegetables.\n\n\nSubstitute pasta by using spaghetti squash, or \u201cspiralize\u201d vegetables such as zucchini or beets. A delicious and refreshing alternative! Do you like cream sauces, such as Alfredo pasta sauce? Try a 5% cream blend for cooking, or use soy plant-based cooking cream for a lower fat version.\n\n\nReplace quiches with omelettes and frittatas. Without crusts, these dishes contain less fat. Containing only 70 calories each, eggs are an excellent weight-loss ally. Two eggs make up a portion. Think about adding them to your salad meals. Note that a healthy adult can have seven eggs weekly.\n\n\nAdd edamame beans to your menu more often. Rich in fibre and protein, they prolong the feeling of fullness, reducing cravings. Boil these frozen beans for four to five minutes and they are ready to be added to your salad meals, Asian dishes, soups, and pasta dishes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutritious snacks\n\n\n\n\nSince fruits and vegetables, as well as milk and milk-substitutes, are among the foods most under-consumed by Canadians,\n[1]\n make them a priority at snack-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContaining twice as much protein as traditional yogurt, 0 or 2% fat Greek yogurt is a perfect snack. Ideally, choose the plain option and flavour it to taste with fruit and a drizzle of honey or maple syrup.\n\n\nInstead of a granola bar, muffin or other commercially prepared bakery product, choose ripe fresh fruit and a few nuts. A much more nourishing and filling combo.\n\n\nLow in calories, try raw vegetables more often. And for a dip, go with plain Greek yogurt with a little pesto.\n\n\nSnack on oven-baked edamame. A great alternative to chips!\n\n\nNeed a more filling snack? Go for a hard-boiled egg and some raw vegetables, or make a homemade smoothie with milk or a soy beverage, fresh fruit, and Greek yogurt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter what or when you eat, it is important to respect your hunger signals and your satiety. Eat only when your body needs to fuel up. And remember that fruits and vegetables should be the focus of your meals. They are very nutritious, so they should make up half of your plate. Meat should be the side dish to your vegetables, not the other way around!\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThis article has been sponsored by BOOST\u00ae, but all comments and opinions are my own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulie DesGroseilliers\n\n\nRegistered Dietitian\n\n\nRegistered Dietitian and nutritionist Julie DesGroseilliers holds a Bachelor of Nutrition and a Minor in Physical Activity Science from the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.

You\u2019re not alone. Many of us depend on our morning coffee to face the day and some describe ebbing energy levels by late afternoon. If you find you\u2019re feeling worn out before the day is done, consider taking a good look at your diet.\n\n\n\n\nBasics of Energy\n\n\n\n\nThink of energy in terms of currency: you need to possess it to spend it. The currency our body uses for energy is called calories. We get calories from the foods and beverages we eat and drink. Since we burn calories all the time, even while sleeping, we need to fuel ourselves daily with a steady diet of nutritious foods.\n\n\n\n\nHow Do We Fuel Energy\n\n\n\n\nWe know that food is more than just a bundle of calories in an edible form. There are macronutrients, vitamins and other nutrients in there, too. All help in their own ways to give us energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrates\n, \nFats\n and \nProtein\n\u202fare called macronutrients, and are sources\u202fof dietary energy. While some foods may provide only one of these macronutrients, think of an apple which is mostly carbohydrate, most foods provide a mix of protein, fat and carbohydrate. Think of a vegetable salad with chickpeas and oil and vinegar dressing \u2013 that\u2019s a blend of all three!\n\n\nVitamins\n\u202falso play an important supporting role when it comes to energy metabolism. Just like cars don\u2019t depend on gasoline alone to run \u2013 they need oil, a clean engine and ongoing maintenance \u2013\u202f\u202f\nB vitamins\n help convert food to energy so your body can run smoothly. \u202f\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the energy from food that helps you feel awake and fight fatigue. Your energy levels can be influenced by things outside of eating too, such as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical activity\n:\u202fIt\u2019s true that when you\u2019re engaging in physical activity, you\u2019re using up energy (burning calories). But over the long term, physical activity gets your heart rate up and\u202f\nhelps your body work more efficiently\n, which ultimately leaves you with more energy to tackle your everyday life.\n\n\nSleep\n:\u202fDaily rest is part of your body\u2019s ongoing maintenance plan. As adults, we typically need\u202f\n7 or 8 hours\n\u202feach night to recover and feel energized and ready for the day ahead. \u202f\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Have More Energy\n\n\n\n\nChanging your diet may be an effective way to get more energy. Try these five simple tips to eat for energy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcentrate on Carbohydrates\n. Your body\u2019s preferred energy source is glucose, \nmade from dietary carbohydrates\n. Foods with fibre and other complex carbohydrates like whole grains, vegetables and fruit will help keep your energy levels stable, avoiding sharp sugar\n\n\nPay Attention to Protein\n. Protein\u202fis an important nutrient for muscle health and to prevent\u202f\nage-related muscle loss.\n Unlike fat and carbohydrates, extra protein can\u2019t be stored in the body. That\u2019s why you need to replenish protein throughout the day, aiming for 20-35 grams \nat every meal\n. Meat, dairy and eggs are good sources of animal proteins, while beans, nuts and soy are plant-based protein options.\n\n\nDon\u2019t Forget Fats\n. Fats are a main source of energy and are needed in the diet to absorb certain vitamins. Just remember that a little goes a long way, since fats are more concentrated sources of calories than carbohydrates and protein. Nuts, olive oil, avocados and fatty fish are all great sources of \nhealthy fats\n.\n\n\nRemember B Vitamins\n. While \nB vitamins\n don\u2019t provide energy themselves, they help our body unlock the energy found in carbohydrates, protein, and fat. If you\u2019re deficient in B vitamins, this can lead to tiredness and fatigue.

Try these seasonal tips to support your health and wellness this autumn, so you can maximize your fall fun:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWash your hands\n. According to \nJohns Hopkins\n, fall often brings an uptick in colds as kids head back to school and many of us start spending more time indoors. Washing your hands often\u2014and being careful not to touch your eyes and nose\u2014can help prevent the common cold.\n\n\nSupplement with Vitamin D\n. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Vitamin D helps build strong bones, supports the immune system, and plays a key role in muscle and nerve function. But because your body makes Vitamin D from sunlight, it can be hard to get enough of this essential nutrient once the days get shorter. Supplementing with \nNature\u2019s Bounty\u00ae Vitamin D3\n is a great way to increase your daily intake of Vitamin D.\n\n\nSupport immune health with Elderberry\n. \nNature\u2019s Bounty\u00ae Elderberry Gummies\n can support the immune system\u2019s health year-round.

While the winter holidays can be a time of cherished family traditions, many people struggle with stress during this season. According to the CDC, some good ways to manage stress include finding support, connecting with others, and making sure you get plenty of sleep.\n\n\nSupport digestive health\n. Starting the new year after indulging over the holidays usually means revising your diet and wellness goals. Practicing healthy eating habits can be a great way to reset. According to the CDC, eating enough fiber is key to supporting digestive health. And, in addition to eating enough fiber, consider adding a probiotic to your routine\u2014\nNature\u2019s Bounty\u00ae Probiotic Gummy\n contains a clinically studied probiotic strain, bursting with the delicious fruit flavour of pineapple, raspberry and orange making them a tasty addition to your supplement routine. \nNature\u2019s Bounty IBGard\u00ae\n uses our patented Site-Specific Technology\u00ae to deliver Peppermint Oil to the small intestine- the primary source of IBS disturbance.

The CDC recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week for adults, so find your passion and get moving!\n\n\nDuring spring cleaning, don\u2019t overlook your supplements\n. To get the most from your vitamins and wellness products, it\u2019s important to make sure they\u2019re fresh.

Formats, identifies that they were produced in a Peanut Free Facility.\n\n\n\n\nAssuring our products are made in a Peanut Free facility means that our facility has rigorous quality control processes

rethink your morning meal. We\u2019ve all heard the saying that\u202f\nbreakfast\n\u202fis the most important meal of the day, but why? Research shows\u202f\nskipping breakfast is associated with nutrient gaps\n, including calcium, iron, fibre and vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, C and D, and these important nutrients commonly consumed at breakfast are not made up later in the day. Not only does a good breakfast break your overnight fast and get your day up and running, but it\u2019s also good for you.\n\n\n\n\nThe Right Mix for a Nutrient-packed Breakfast\n\n\n\n\nDone right, a good breakfast will include foods that satisfy your hunger for at least 2-3 hours, keeping you full until your next meal or between-meal snack. It should include a mix of carbohydrates, which give you energy to fuel your body, plus proteins to support muscle and immune health.\n\n\n\n\nThe Power of Protein\n\n\n\n\nProtein is particularly important at breakfast time. That\u2019s because unlike carbohydrates and fats, your body can\u2019t store extra protein \u2013 so it \nworks best if protein is spread out throughout the day, starting with breakfast\n. Keeping protein-rich foods and protein drinks on hand, like\u202f\nBOOST\u00ae SIMPLY + Vanilla Nutrition Drink\n , to have as a snack or to help round out a nutrient-packed breakfast helps you reach your protein target each day.\n\n\n\n\nMost people pile on the protein at dinner, with steak or chicken at the center of the plate. Ideally, we should be spreading out our protein intake across every meal and snack throughout the day, aiming for about 20-35g protein each meal. Check out \nCanada's Food Guide\n for what makes up a healthy food plate.\u202f\n\n\n\n\nOlder adults\n\u202fneed to pay extra attention to protein, since we need more of it than we did when we were younger. For example, a healthy 65-year-old weighing 150 pounds needs at least 75 grams of protein per day, compared to 55 grams of protein for an adult in their twenties, weighing the same. (Learn more about your individual needs\u202f\nhere\n.)\n\n\n\n\nFive Protein-Packed Breakfast Ideas\n\n\n\n\nThere is a nutrient-packed breakfast for everyone, whether you have time for a sit-down meal or need something quick to take on the go. Here are five protein breakfast ideas that will satisfy your stomach and tantalize your taste buds:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a Protein Shake\n. The ultimate easy breakfast, a\u202f\nhigh-protein shake\n\u202fis great when time is tight, and you have some produce that you need to use up. A high-speed blender is best, but a food processor or immersion blender can work just as well. Use milk or BOOST\u00ae High Protein Nutritional Drink as a liquid protein base, then add whatever fruits and/or vegetables you have on hand to give you some vitamins and minerals.\n\n\nPrepare Overnight Oats\n. Another easy breakfast option is one that you prep the night before. Preparing rolled oats with milk or BOOST\u00ae Nutritional Drink not only increases the protein but gives you extra flavor and creaminess. Add in whatever toppings or mix-ins you\u2019d like. For a tasty treat that try this recipe for\u202f \nBOOST\u00ae High Protein Strawberries and Cream Overnight Oats\n\n\nMake a Yogurt Parfait\n. Another easy breakfast idea that requires little prep work is a cup of yogurt with chia seeds. Greek yogurt or Icelandic skyr options contain more protein than traditional yogurt. Add a topping of chia or pumpkin seeds for crunch and 3-4 grams of protein per two tablespoons. Top with some berries or sliced bananas for sweetness and extra nutrition\n\n\nPrepare High Protein Pancakes or Waffles\n. Whether you eat them fresh or make once to freeze and reheat later,\u202f\nthis banana chocolate pancake recipe\n\u202fusing\u202f\nBOOST\u00ae High Protein Chocolate Nutritional Drink\n\u202f adds protein and add some delicious, familiar flavours everyone will enjoy. Buckwheat flour is used in the base and gives these breakfast flapjacks extra fibre and texture.\n\n\nMake a Breakfast Sandwich\n. If a hot breakfast is what you crave, save a trip to the drive-through and make your own egg sandwich. Just toast an English muffin (you\u2019ll get more fibre and a little more protein if it\u2019s whole wheat) and cook up 1-2 eggs. Melt some cheese and add a slice of ham or turkey, and you\u2019ve got a healthy breakfast in the palm of your hand!\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBack to top\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 Foods that Give You Energy\n \n \n \nBrand\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExploring Heart Health & Omega-3 Supplements Beyond Fish Oil \n \n \n \nNutrition\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNestl\u00e9 Canada\u2019s Nesquik proudly sponsors the First-Ever National Make Happy Tummies Campaign \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 Elements of Eating for Energy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDigestive Balance: It\u2019s in your Nature to Thrive\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKids  gummies\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpotlight on the Sunshine Vitamin\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSupport Year-Round Health with Wellness Tips for Every Season\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 Foods that Give You Energy\n \n \n \nBrand\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExploring Heart Health & Omega-3 Supplements Beyond Fish Oil \n \n \n \nNutrition\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNestl\u00e9 Canada\u2019s Nesquik proudly sponsors the First-Ever National Make Happy Tummies Campaign \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 Elements of Eating for Energy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDigestive Balance: It\u2019s in your Nature to Thrive\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKids  gummies\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpotlight on the Sunshine Vitamin\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSupport Year-Round Health with Wellness Tips for Every Season\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\u2713\nThanks for sharing!\nFind any service\nAddToAny\nMore\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.
