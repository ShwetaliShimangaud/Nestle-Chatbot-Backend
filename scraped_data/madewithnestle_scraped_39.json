       Tweet\n            \n\n              Email\n            \n\n              Pin\n            \n\n            Print\n          \n \n \nFor more than a century we\u2019ve been a part of Canadians\u2019 lives, helping put food on our tables by employing Canadians, working with local suppliers and making food and beverages we all enjoy. In fact, we\u2019ve being around so long that John A. MacDonald was Prime Minister when we first started doing business in Canada in 1887. \u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s with this long history in mind that we\u2019re focusing on Canada\u2019s future. We care deeply about our home and all Canadians, and we\u2019re doing our part when it comes to nutrition, health and wellness, sustainability and social impact. We want to provide a transparent update on how we\u2019re tracking against our goals, which we aim to do by sharing our 2015 Creating Shared Value Report.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile the report is a look back on our progress so far, throughout 2016 we\u2019ll be working to continuously improve our products, our company and our place in Canadians\u2019 lives. A few examples of the goals we\u2019re working towards this year include:\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0\nImproving the nutritional profile\n\u00a0of a range of our products, by reducing sodium, saturated fat, and sugar by 10% by the end of 2016. For example, we\u2019ve already reduced the sugar content in our Ready-to-Drink Carnation Breakfast Essentials by 40%\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0Offering more than\u00a0\n5,000 young Canadians\n\u00a0a chance to develop and expand their professional skills, and increase their employability over three years through Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Youth Initiative. After just launching at the end of 2015, 1,800 students have already participated in our readiness for work\u00a0events\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0Completely\u00a0\neliminating the waste we send to landfills\n\u00a0from our factories by 2020. As of 2015, we\u2019ve already achieved zero waste-to-landfill in three Ontario-based factories: our ice cream factory in London, our chocolate factory in Toronto, and our foodservice factory in Trenton\n\n\nBy improving our ecological footprint, supporting young Canadians and improving the nutritional value of our products we\u2019re working tirelessly to improve everything we do. We know we\u2019re not perfect and have a long journey in front of us, but we\u2019re committed to providing the best for Canadians and providing updates along the way.\n\n\nTo learn more about our initiatives, goals and progress this year,\u00a0\nclick to read the 2015 Nestl\u00e9 in Canada Creating Shared Value Report\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBack to top\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 Foods that Give You Energy\n \n \n \nBrand\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExploring Heart Health & Omega-3 Supplements Beyond Fish Oil \n \n \n \nNutrition\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNestl\u00e9 Canada\u2019s Nesquik proudly sponsors the First-Ever National Make Happy Tummies Campaign \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPay Attention to Protein at Breakfast \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 Elements of Eating for Energy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDigestive Balance: It\u2019s in your Nature to Thrive\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKids  gummies\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpotlight on the Sunshine Vitamin\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 Foods that Give You Energy\n \n \n \nBrand\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExploring Heart Health & Omega-3 Supplements Beyond Fish Oil \n \n \n \nNutrition\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNestl\u00e9 Canada\u2019s Nesquik proudly sponsors the First-Ever National Make Happy Tummies Campaign \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPay Attention to Protein at Breakfast \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 Elements of Eating for Energy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDigestive Balance: It\u2019s in your Nature to Thrive\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKids  gummies\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpotlight on the Sunshine Vitamin\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\u2713\nThanks for sharing!\nFind any service\nAddToAny\nMore\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.
