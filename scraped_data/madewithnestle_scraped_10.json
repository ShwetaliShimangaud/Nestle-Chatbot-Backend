Columbia Coffee Ground\n\n\n\n\nAt 2000 metres of elevation, Colombian farms produce amazing coffee with round body, juicy tastes and a nutty finish that\u2019s worth the journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarbucks Colombia VIA Instant\n\n\n\n\nAt 2000 metres of elevation, Colombian farms produce amazing coffee with round body, juicy tastes and a nutty finish that\u2019s worth the journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarbucks Costa Rica Latin American Blend\n\n\n\n\nTo balance the vibrant notes and accentuate the brightness Costa Rican coffees contribute, we blended in beans from Latin America, creating this\u00a0 distinctly elegant cup with a soft lemony sweetness and smooth cocoa texture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarbucks Kenya African Blend\n\n\n\n\nFor this refined blend, we started with coffee from Kenya and then coaxed out its bright sweetness and balanced East African beans. Every Intriguing sip reveals hints of tropical fruit and brown sugar.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarbucks Caramel Flavoured Coffee Ground\n\n\n\n\nSo simple. So sweet. Caramel adds just the right touch of richness to every cup. Our blend of caramel flavour with a medium-roasted coffee creates moments to savour from the brewing aroma to the very last sip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst page\n\n\n\u00ab First\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious page\n\n\n\u2039 Previous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n275\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n276\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Current page\n            \n277\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n278\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n279\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext page\n\n\nNext \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast page\n\n\nLast \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.
