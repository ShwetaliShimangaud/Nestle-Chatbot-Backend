Respectfully\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter grown beans\n\n\nWe\u2019re proud to call the men and women who grow our coffee beans our partner farmers. NESCAF\u00c9 experts visit their farms to pass on innovative sustainable agricultural practices that help them earn more, stay healthier and work more in tune with nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanadian targets and ambitions\n\n\nTO SOURCE OUR COFFEE RESONSIBLY\n \u2013\u00a0Our coffee is sourced and certified through established and internationally recognised partners: 4C, Rainforest Alliance and UTZ.\n\n\nTO RESPECT FARMERS\n \u2013\u00a0We deliver over 100,000 trainings per year to upskill farmers\u2019 business knowledge and help them grow higher yielding or more disease resistant plants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt takes generations to make coffee taste this good\n\n\nSome growers are the children or grandchildren of the first farmers we helped.\n\n\nAs of December 2020, we distributed more than \n100 million new disease-resistant coffee plantlets to over 54,000 farmers in Mexico and Colombia\n. Then we spent the next 2-3 years helping farmers tend their new \u2018babies\u2019.\n\n\nThese great farming partnerships have been formed over decades resulting in a strong bond between coffee growers and NESCAF\u00c9\u2019s experts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolar powered beans\n\n\nSoggy coffee beans are no good to anyone. Dry beans keep for longer, giving farmers more time to negotiate their sale. NESCAF\u00c9 agronomists are encouraging our partner farmers in Honduras to dry their coffee beans on their farms instead of paying someone else to do it. Once solar dryers are installed, it costs virtually nothing to run them. Yet it means our partner farmers can get more cash for their new supercharged, super-dry, better-quality beans.\n\n\nHonduran farmers using solar dryers can get an average $160 more per hectare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext gen female farmers\n\n\nOne of the ways we\u2019re helping to improve lives in coffee-growing communities is to empower women farmers financially. With profit comes socio-economic empowerment and financial freedom.\n\n\nSo far \n3,500 Rwandan women have benefitted from a program launched by Nestl\u00e9 in 2016 in collaboration with the Kahawatu Foundation.\n\n\nBy teaching them about financial literacy, global coffee prices, pruning, weeding, mulching, and harvesting, we equip them to make their farming efforts more profitable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe partner with the Rainforest Alliance to monitor and evaluate the progress of our work in farm economics, as well as social and environmental impact. With this vital data we are able to adapt and improve our work, helping to bring long-term sustainability to thousands of coffee farmers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCup of Respect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrown Respectfully\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMade Respectfully\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackaged Respectfully\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.

Respectfully\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTackle climate change with \n        \nevery cup\n\n\nWe\u2019re respecting the planet by working to make all our coffee production more sustainable. That means encouraging agricultural biodiversity on the land, saving water and reducing carbon emissions at every step of the way from farm to factory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanadian targets and ambitions\n\n\nCARBON RESPECT\n \u2013\u00a0We have a clear target and roadmap to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and halve them by 2030. \u00a0\n\n\nWATER RESPECT\n \u2013 We reduced water use across our operation and worked with farmers in Vietnam to maintain the same high yield from their crops using 30-40% less water.\n\n\nBIODIVERSITY RESPECT\n \u2013\u00a0We promote biodiversity on farms through multicropping which rewards farmers for doing things like planting new hedgerows and wildflowers in the edges of their fields. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat tasting coffee 15 years in the making\n\n\nWe breed easier-to-grow, and more disease-resistant coffee trees that produce more flavoursome beans on behalf of our coffee growers. We\u2019ve given out 235 million plantlets so far.\n\n\nIt takes about 15 years to create new elite varieties, and another five to test the trees in the local conditions where they\u2019ll grow.\n\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve released \n10 new delicious arabica varieties and five new robusta\n. Ongoing trials will continue to deliver more deliciousness in years to come. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting less water in our coffee\n\n\nWe\u2019ve demonstrated that quality coffee can be grown using 50-70% less irrigation water. If all farmers adopted this practice, it could save the equivalent of 30% of yearly water consumption. \n\n\nTo help optimise water use, we developed a free weather forecasting app tailored to each farmer\u2019s area showing them the best time to irrigate their crops.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve also improved the efficiency of our factories, saving the equivalent of 7,850 Olympic swimming pools of water every year. \nThat\u2019s 56 billion coffee cups\n \u2013 enough to go round the Earth 126 times! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteaming ahead\n\n\nWe use steam to create the spray-dried coffee in your NESCAF\u00c9 Rich. Our best-in-class plants burn the waste coffee grounds for fuel to make the steam (grounds were previously thrown away). \n\n\nInnovative nozzles that use 50% less steam are being installed and we are proud to say we\u2019ve reduced carbon emissions from our factories by half in the last 10 years. That\u2019s the same as the \nfuel load of 1,058 wide-bodied passenger jets\n \u2013 every year! Our goal is to reach net zero. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe partner with the Rainforest Alliance to monitor and evaluate the progress of our work in farm economics, as well as social and environmental impact. With this vital data we are able to adapt and improve our work, helping to bring long-term sustainability to thousands of coffee farmers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCup of Respect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrown Respectfully\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMade Respectfully\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackaged Respectfully\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.

and farmers. \n \n \nThe future of coffee can\u2019t exist without making sustainability a priority. We are devoted to implementing practices that aim to protect coffee farming and coffee farmers, now and in the future.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What\u2019s agroforestry? \n \n \nWe use agroforestry on our coffee farms. This means we intentionally grow other trees and plants around our coffee farms to provide shade, improve biodiversity, protect water bodies, and support water retention. It also aims to reduce soil erosion, increase soil cover and capture carbon from the air.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n Customizing our approach on coffee farms. \n \n \nCoffee farming isn\u2019t one-size-fits-all. That\u2019s why our agronomists work closely with our coffee farmers to recommend solutions that are right for them, their land, their climate conditions and their landscape.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n Our progress so far \n \n \nWe\u2019re committed to Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030 and are cultivating a difference with every cup.

\n \n \nYour beloved morning beverage would not be possible without our partner communities, which is why we work closely with more than 100,000 coffee farmers worldwide. We\u2019re dedicated to supporting them by piloting new coffee farming approaches to help improve livelihoods.\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Make Your World from bean to cup \n \n \nIt all starts where we grow our beans. That\u2019s why we work closely with coffee farmers to help them attain more sustainable farming practices. Some of the ways we do this are by introducing improved coffee plants, optimizing fertilization, and reinforcing agroforestry systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n Helping farmers make a change \n \n \nFrom providing cash incentives for farms that adopt regenerative farming practices to creating weather insurance plans, we\u2019re giving our farmers the support they need to be more sustainable, efficient, prosperous, and resilient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n Empowering farmers \n \n \nThrough various processes and tactics such as compost fertiliers and rejuvenating tree stock, we can help our farmers increase their coffee yields. We\u2019re also helping more and more young people get ready for a career in coffee with our Youth Initiative programs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n Our progress so far \n \n \nWe\u2019re committed to Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030 and are cultivating a difference with every cup.

Consuming less grass than cattle, bison is a reliable and abundant food source \u2013 providing not only nutrition for Indigenous people, but hides to make clothing and blankets, bones to create tools, jewelry, and fats used for cooking. All parts of the animal were used \u2013 and this chili recipe is a nod to sustainable cooking inspired by the First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n25\n \n45\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n NESCAF\u00c9 Italian Biscotti \n \n \nBiscotti, also known as cantucci originated in the Tuscan city of Prato.

Unlike American- and European-style short ribs, which include a thick slice of bone-in beef, Korean-style short ribs are cut lengthwise across the rib bone. The lengthwise cut helps to soak up the rich, Korean flavor\u2013infused coffee marinade and serves to help grill it up quickly.\n\n\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.

by adding water. There was a growing surplus of coffee beans in Brazil as a result of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Nestl\u00e9 saw an opportunity to help preserve coffee supply.\n\n\nMax and his team worked hard to find a new way to make instant coffee that would retain the coffee\u2019s original flavour. In 1938, they found the answer, and NESCAF\u00c9 was born.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NESCAF\u00c9 brand is born\n\n\nNamed by using the first three letters in Nestl\u00e9 and suffixing it with \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, NESCAF\u00c9 became the new name in coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstant Success!\n\n\nMaking coffee had never been this fast and easy. During WWII NESCAF\u00c9 became a staple food ration for US forces. (Pictured) A Swiss newspaper advert highlights the speed and ease of making a NESCAF\u00c9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Top of the World\n\n\nDuring their record-breaking expedition to Mount Everest in 1953, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, bring a trusty little tin of NESCAF\u00c9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Founding Factory\n\n\nThis factory in Orbe, Switzerland has been producing our products since we started it all back in 1938.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassy Glass\n\n\nIn 1961, we launched our first glass jar, in Japan. It was a huge success and helped position NESCAF\u00c9 as a premium product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing for Gold\n\n\nWe launched NESCAF\u00c9 Gold, a classic premium blend, in Germany, France and the UK in the mid-1960\u2019s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the Moon and Back\n\n\nThe first coffee to land on the moon. NESCAF\u00c9 joined the crew of Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, in their pioneering mission in 1969.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping Conscious Coffee\n\n\nIn 2010, we started to focus on more sustainable development and created the NESCAF\u00c9 Plan. It\u2019s a way to help coffee farmers make a better living; support local communities; inspire the next generation of farmers; and do so without damaging our planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday\n\n\nThe world\u2019s favourite coffee. NESCAF\u00c9 is enjoyed in over 180 countries. Our coffee is \ngrown\n, \nmade\n and \npackaged\n in a way that respects the environment and the people who farm our coffee beans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay connected\n\n\n\n        Follow us on our social media accounts to get even more tasty content.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.
