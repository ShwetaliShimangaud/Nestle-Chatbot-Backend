This summer, turn \nCarnation Hot Chocolate\n into a refreshing treat with our playful and delicious twists. If you are looking for a cool summer treat, these ideas are sure to be a hit with both kids and adults.\n\n\n\n\n1. \u00a0\nFrozen Hot Chocolate\n\n\n\n\nNot quite ice cream but frostier than a milkshake, frozen hot chocolate tastes like a lighter version of those summertime classics with a chocolate twist. Just whip Carnation Hot Chocolate, milk and ice together in a blender until smooth. If you're looking for extra chocolatey flavour, add chocolate milk instead of plain milk or water. Non-dairy alternatives also work just as well.\n\n\n\n\n2. Iced Hot Chocolate\n\n\n\n\nTransform Carnation Hot Chocolate into a cool, creamy beverage. Simply make your hot chocolate as usual, let it cool slightly, and then pour over ice. Add a splash of milk or cream for extra richness. It's like your favourite chocolate milk but with the deep flavour of hot cocoa.\n\n\n\n\n3. Hot Chocolate Ice Pops\n\n\n\n\nPour cooled Carnation Hot Chocolate into popsicle moulds, add a stick, and freeze. For a fun twist, layer with vanilla or strawberry yogurt for a Neapolitan effect. It's a perfect grab-and-go treat that will keep the kids cool and happy.\n\n\n\n\n4. Hot Chocolate Affogato\n\n\n\n\nFor a grown-up treat, place a scoop of \nH\u00e4agen-Dazs \nvanilla or chocolate ice cream in a bowl, and pour a shot of espresso mixed with a shot of cooled, concentrated Carnation Hot Chocolate over it. This twist on the classic affogato gives you the boldness of espresso coupled with the rich, comforting taste of chocolate, melting over the creamy ice cream for an indulgent, multi-textured dessert.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5. Hot Chocolate Float\n\n\n\n\nFill a tall glass halfway with chilled Carnation Hot Chocolate, then carefully add a scoop of \nH\u00e4agen-Dazs\n ice cream. As the ice cream melts, it creates a wonderfully creamy chocolate drink. Experiment with different ice cream flavours like coffee or salted caramel for a unique twist.\n\n\n\n\n6. Sundae Toppings with Hot Chocolate\n\n\n\n\nMake a batch of \nFrozen Hot Chocolate\n and top it with traditional sundae toppings for a fun treat! Looking for topping ideas? Here are some we recommend. Mix and match and make it yours!\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Whipped cream: Homemade or from a can, it\u2019s the perfect frozen hot chocolate topper. Say \u201cwhen!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A drizzle of your favourite \nNESQUIK\u00ae Syrup\n: Looking for maximum chocolate flavour? Reach for \nNESQUIK\u00ae\n Chocolate Syrup. Want a perfect balance of tart and sweet? NESQUIK\u00ae Strawberry is your go-to.\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Carnation Hot Chocolate powder: Sometimes a little extra goes a long way.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Shaved chocolate: We recommend \nAERO\n or AERO mint!\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Topped with crushed mini \nKITKAT\n: Crush them in the package if you want a quick and easy cleanup.\n\n\n\n\n8. Cold Mocha\n\n\n\n\nMix cooled Carnation Hot Chocolate with chilled coffee and pour over ice. Add milk or cream to lighten it up, and a touch of sugar if you like it sweet. This cold mocha is a refreshing pick-me-up on a warm summer day, combining the best of both worlds\u2014coffee and chocolate. Have flavoured syrups on hand? They're also a perfect flavour injection! We recommend mint, salted caramel, or hazelnut.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHot chocolate isn\u2019t just a cozy season drink anymore. With these eight ideas, you can enjoy its chocolatey goodness year round.

\nPets de s\u0153ur, literally translated as Nun farts, and also known to some as \u201cCroxignolles\u201d is a French-Canadian dessert that is often made up from left over pie dough; at times from Tourti\u00e8re. This quick and easy dessert was can be craft to avoid food waste and ensure that\u202fevery last\u202fingredient and bite is enjoyed and devoured. This take on a classic French-Canadian treat is rolled with an irresistible Carnation Hot Chocolate and cinnamon filling, then baked instead of fried.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20\n \n20\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nBack to top\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\u2713\nThanks for sharing!\nFind any service\nAddToAny\nMore\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.

Quebecois cuisine, this ooey-gooey tart is a Canadian holiday classic. Originally made with just maple syrup for sweetness, as it was a common ingredient in the region, the recipe has been adapted over the years to include brown sugar as well. This modern version includes nutty Turtles chocolates and creamy Mackintosh Caramels for extra flavour, enhanced texture and added indulgence.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n30\n \n61\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bite-Size Chocolate Cinnamon Pets de Soeur \n \n \nPets de s\u0153ur, literally translated as Nun farts, and also known to some as \u201cCroxignolles\u201d is a French-Canadian dessert that is often made up from left over pie dough; at times from Tourti\u00e8re. This quick and easy dessert was can be craft to avoid food waste and ensure that\u202fevery last\u202fingredient and bite is enjoyed and devoured. This take on a classic French-Canadian treat is rolled with an irresistible Carnation Hot Chocolate and cinnamon filling, then baked instead of fried.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20\n \n20\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n TURTLES Mason Jar S\u2019more Parfait \n \n \nLayer on the love with an indulgent treat that\u2019s guaranteed to leave the whole family wanting s\u2019more!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n TURTLES Pecan Praline Popcorn Balls \n \n \nWe're lovin' the 'no oven' for this creation (more time to bask in sweet & salty bliss).\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n \n5\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sweet & Salty TURTLES S'mmmores \n \n \nJust add bonfire!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n \n5\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n TURTLES Cheesecake Pops \n \n \nAdd a fun twist to traditional pumpkin treats this Thanksgiving with TURTLES.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n25\n \n5\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nBack to top\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\u2713\nThanks for sharing!\nFind any service\nAddToAny\nMore\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.

Originally made with just maple syrup for sweetness, as it was a common ingredient in the region, the recipe has been adapted over the years to include brown sugar as well. This modern version includes nutty Turtles chocolates and creamy Mackintosh Caramels for extra flavour, enhanced texture and added indulgence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrep time:\n\n\n30\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCook time:\n\n\n61\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal time:\n\n\n93\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServings:\n\n\n12\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Share\n            \n\n              Tweet\n            \n\n              Email\n            \n\n              Pin\n            \n\n              Yum\n            \n\n            Print\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Share\n            \n\n              Tweet\n            \n\n              Email\n            \n\n              Pin\n            \n\n              Yum\n            \n\n            Print\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients\nPreparation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1 1/2 cups (375 mL) all-purpose flour\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n2 tsp (10 mL) granulated sugar\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1/2 tsp (2 mL) salt\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1/2 cup (125 mL) cold butter, cubed\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n2 eggs\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1 cup (250 mL) packed brown sugar\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1/4 cup (60 mL) pure maple syrup\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1 cup (250 mL) heavy or whipping (35%) cream\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n2 tbsp (30 mL) all-purpose flour\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1/4 tsp (1 mL) salt\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1 cup (250 mL) chopped Turtles chocolates\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1/2 cup (125 mL) chopped Mackintosh Caramels\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n12 whole Turtles chocolates\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDough: To food processor, add flour, sugar and salt; pulse to combine.
