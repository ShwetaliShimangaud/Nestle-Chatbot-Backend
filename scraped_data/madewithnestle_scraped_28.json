Asked Questions \n \n Action link    \n \n \n \n\n\n \n Ingredients \n \n \n \nWhat ingredients are in NESCAF\u00c9 instant coffee and decaffeinated instant coffee?\nWhat is the caffeine content for all of your NESCAF\u00c9 products?\nAre NESCAF\u00c9 products gluten-free?\nAre the NESCAF\u00c9 Sweet and Creamy sachets vegan or vegetarian?\nAre any NESCAF\u00c9 coffees Kosher?\nWhat decaffeination process do you use?\nWhat is the meaning of \"artificial flavoring\" on the label of NESCAF\u00c9 Rich Hazelnut?\nWhy do you use acesulfame-potassium in NESCAF\u00c9 Rich Hazelnut flavor?\nWhat are Arabica beans?\nWhat are Robusta beans?\nDo farmers use a lot of pesticides on the coffee beans? Do you test for glyphosate residues?\n \n \nWhat ingredients are in NESCAF\u00c9 instant coffee and decaffeinated instant coffee?\n \n \n \n \nOur pure roast and ground and instant coffees are both made from a single ingredient: green coffee.\u00a0\n\n\nGreen coffees are seeds of coffee cherries grown on coffee trees. That means that our pure roast and ground, and instant coffees are both natural food products. If any other flavours or ingredients are added to an instant coffee product, it would be indicated on the package. For example, a flavour-added instant coffee would be named FLAVOURED INSTANT COFFEE. We follow the Canadian Food Inspection Agency\u2019s strict guidelines when labeling our pre-packaged food products.\n\n\n \n \n \nWhat is the caffeine content for all of your NESCAF\u00c9 products?\n \n \n \n \nA serving size is typically one rounded teaspoon. This guide shows approximately how much caffeine is present in a typical 6oz serving of prepared coffee. Amount is in milligrams.\u00a0\n\n\nNESCAF\u00c9 Colombian: 80-100 mg\n\nNESCAF\u00c9 Decaf: > 5 mg\n\nNESCAF\u00c9 Espresso: 90\u2013110 mg\u00a0\n\nNESCAF\u00c9 Dark Roast: 60\u201380 mg\u00a0\n\nAll NESCAF\u00c9 SSOD/Single Serve on Demand coffee products (capsules): 80\u2013100 mg\n\n\n \n \n \nAre NESCAF\u00c9 products gluten-free?\n \n \n \n \nIf there are no gluten sources listed in the ingredient list (wheat, rye, barley, triticale, oat) then a product does not contain gluten. We recommend that you always check the label on your packaging to get the most up-to-date information.\n\n\n \n \n \nAre the NESCAF\u00c9 Sweet and Creamy sachets vegan or vegetarian?\n \n \n \n \nNESCAF\u00c9 Sweet & Creamy products are not vegetarian or vegan as they contain milk products.\n\n\n \n \n \nAre any NESCAF\u00c9 coffees Kosher?\n \n \n \n \nNESCAF\u00c9 Taster's Choice 100g jars, Classic and Decaf are not Kosher certified. For that reason, they do not have the Kosher certified symbol on the package. The reason they are no longer certified Kosher is because we switched manufacturing locations and the new location is not Kosher approved at this time.\n\n\n \n \n \nWhat decaffeination process do you use?\n \n \n \n \nAll NESCAF\u00c9 decaf coffees are decaffeinated using water to remove the caffeine from the beans. If you have additional questions regarding our decaf coffee, here are some answers to our most frequently asked questions:\n\u00a0https://www.madewithnestle.ca/nescafe-decaffeination-process\n\n\n \n \n \nWhat is the meaning of \"artificial flavoring\" on the label of NESCAF\u00c9 Rich Hazelnut?\n \n \n \n \nIt is artificial, meaning that the source of flavour materials is not from a hazelnut but synthetic. It also means that the product does not contain hazelnut for people with nut allergies.\n\n\n \n \n \nWhy do you use acesulfame-potassium in NESCAF\u00c9 Rich Hazelnut flavor?\n \n \n \n \nThe acesulfame-potassium is an approved Health Canada ingredient. It enhances the hazelnut flavour to provide a great sensory profile of coffee and hazelnuts.\n\n\n \n \n \nWhat are Arabica beans?\n \n \n \n \n\n\n70% of the world\u2019s coffee\n\n\nProne to disease & pests which makes it difficult to grow\n\n\nGrown at altitudes over 2000 ft above sea level\n\n\nMore flavourful & aromatic\n\n\nHigher priced than Robusta\n\n\nHalf the caffeine of Robusta\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWhat are Robusta beans?\n \n \n \n \n\n\nSmaller rounder beans\n\n\nEasier to grow, greater resistance to disease & pests\n\n\nTolerant to higher temperatures and wetter climates\n\n\nGrown at 300 - 800 ft above sea level\n\n\nGrows faster and yields bigger crops\n\n\nEdgy, more powerful flavour\n\n\nLess fragrant\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDo farmers use a lot of pesticides on the coffee beans? Do you test for glyphosate residues?\n \n \n \n \nWe always make sure that the quality and safety of our products is our top priority. We begin by carefully selecting our ingredients and raw materials.\n\n\nThat includes strict quality assurance measures to control and verify pesticide residues.\n\n\nOur standards guarantee that we\u2019re in line with all Canada, US and EU regulatory requirements. We are always closely following innovative scientific and regulatory developments to maintain our high quality and food safety standards.\n\n\nNestl\u00e9 carries out more than 6 million food safety analyses per year, and that includes testing for glyphosate residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n Use and Storage \n \n \n \nWhat is the shelf life of NESCAF\u00c9 products after the container is open?\nI just opened my NESCAF\u00c9 Taster's Choice Coffee canister and it's only half full. Why is that?\nCan I put my NESCAF\u00c9 Taster's Choice in the fridge or freezer?\nWhat is the general shelf life of Ice Java? How should it be stored?\nWhich machine are the coffee pods compatible with?\n \n \nWhat is the shelf life of NESCAF\u00c9 products after the container is open?\n \n \n \n \nOpened NESCAF\u00c9 products are still safe to drink up to the Best Before date on the packaging. The shelf life is maintained as long as the product is stored securely closed in a cool dry place.\n\n\n \n \n \nI just opened my NESCAF\u00c9 Taster's Choice Coffee canister and it's only half full. Why is that?\n \n \n \n \nNESCAF\u00c9 Taster\u2019s Choice granules can settle during shipping, which makes the canister appear less full. Each canister is filled to an average weight in excess of the guarantee. The Quality Assurance team at our plant also makes sure that the fillers are functioning properly by checking the final weight of each of our canisters before they leave our manufacturing facilities.\u00a0\n\n\n \n \n \nCan I put my NESCAF\u00c9 Taster's Choice in the fridge or freezer?\n \n \n \n \nWe recommend storing opened coffee in a cupboard, or pantry. It's best to store it in a cool dry place with the lid tightly closed. If the product is stored correctly, the contents should last from 4-6 weeks.\nIt can be refrigerated however, freezing is not recommended.\n \n \n \n \nWhat is the general shelf life of Ice Java? How should it be stored?\n \n \n \n \nThe shelf-life of Ice Java Cappuccino is 18 months.\nOnce it\u2019s opened, Ice Java can be left ambient or stored in the refrigerator. If you refrigerate the product, you may notice some sugar crystallization.\n \n \n \n \nWhich machine are the coffee pods compatible with?\n \n \n \n \nOur pods work with all Keurig machines.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n Comparing NESCAF\u00c9 products \n \n \n \nIs there a difference between NESCAF\u00c9 Tasters Choice and NESCAF\u00c9 Gold?\nWhat is the difference between NESCAF\u00c9 Rich and NESCAF\u00c9 Taster's choice?\nWhat is the difference between NESCAF\u00c9 Sweet & Creamy and NESCAF\u00c9 RICH?\nIs there any difference between the NESCAF\u00c9 Gold Espresso in Canada and the NESCAF\u00c9 Gold Espresso Italy?\nWhat is the difference between spray dried coffee and freeze dried coffee?\n \n \nIs there a difference between NESCAF\u00c9 Tasters Choice and NESCAF\u00c9 Gold?\n \n \n \n \nThere is! The main difference between NESCAF\u00c9 Tasters Choice and NESCAF\u00c9 Gold is the Microgrind process. That means we take Arabica beans and grind them 10 times finer than regular coffee. This process makes for a more full-bodied coffee experience.\n\n\nIf you aren't a fan of the microgrind, we still have options that we think will suit your taste. We recommend trying NESCAF\u00c9 Taster's Choice coffee because it doesn't have the grinds at the bottom and will be a lighter cup of coffee.\u00a0\n\n\n \n \n \nWhat is the difference between NESCAF\u00c9 Rich and NESCAF\u00c9 Taster's choice?\n \n \n \n \nThe main difference is that NESCAF\u00c9 Rich is spray dried coffee and NESCAF\u00c9 Taster's Choice is freeze dried. This is the technical process that goes into producing the coffee and that is why the granules appear different. Freeze dried is considered to be more premium and high quality, which is why NESCAF\u00c9 Taster's Choice is more expensive than NESCAF\u00c9 Rich.\n\n\n \n \n \nWhat is the difference between NESCAF\u00c9 Sweet & Creamy and NESCAF\u00c9 RICH?\n \n \n \n \nNESCAF\u00c9 Sweet & Creamy is a blend of beans from Brazil, dark roasted similar to NESCAF\u00c9 Rich. NESCAF\u00c9 Sweet and Creamy is all in one solution, with coffee, cream and sugar. NESCAF\u00c9 Rich is a line-up of black and flavoured coffees.\n\n\n \n \n \nIs there any difference between the NESCAF\u00c9 Gold Espresso in Canada and the NESCAF\u00c9 Gold Espresso Italy?\n \n \n \n \nBoth products are made at the same facility, so you can enjoy the same familiar taste whether you\u2019ve purchased it in Canada or Italy!\n\n\n \n \n \nWhat is the difference between spray dried coffee and freeze dried coffee?\n \n \n \n \nAn important step in the \nNESCAF\u00c9\n\u00a0process is drying the coffee. During this step we lock in the flavour ensuring it is perfectly preserved until it is ready to be consumed. There are two methods used to dry the coffee: spray drying and freeze drying.\n\n\nWhen we spray dry the coffee, we use heat to evaporate the water from the coffee. This is done very quickly in a tower by spraying the coffee into warm air. This results in coffee with a darker color and texture like \nNESCAF\u00c9\u00a0\nRich. We can also freeze dry the coffee. In this case we freeze the coffee, which separates water from the coffee solids and turns it into ice crystals that contain only pure water. We then carefully remove the ice crystals using a process called sublimation which turns them from a solid directly to a gas. This process is very gentle and preserves the finest quality of our premium coffees like\u00a0\nNESCAF\u00c9\n\u00a0Gold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n Packaging \n \n \n \nAre NESCAF\u00c9 jars recyclable?\nWhat are the recycling numbers for the material used for the lids of NESCAF\u00c9 Gold and NESCAF\u00c9 Taster's Choice?\nAre the pods recyclable?\nAre the ingredients in the NESCAF\u00c9 jar foil freshness seals safe?\n \n \nAre NESCAF\u00c9 jars recyclable?\n \n \n \n \nYes, they are. We also encourage you reuse it for other purposes.\u00a0\n\n\n \n \n \nWhat are the recycling numbers for the material used for the lids of NESCAF\u00c9 Gold and NESCAF\u00c9 Taster's Choice?\n \n \n \n \nBoth lids are PP (Polypropylene): number 5 material This information is mentioned on the lids\u2019 inner surface.\n\n\n \n \n \nAre the pods recyclable?\n \n \n \n \nYes, the pods are recyclable anywhere where plastic #5 is accepted. However, because each local municipality has its own bylaws around recycling programs, you should consult your local recycling guide, or reach out to your local Municipality directly to see if they're currently recycling plastic #5.\nWe provide steps for proper recycling on all of our packaging.\n \n \n \n \nAre the ingredients in the NESCAF\u00c9 jar foil freshness seals safe?\n \n \n \n \nThe materials used in our seals are food-grade approved by Health Canada, so they're safe for food contact.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n Where NESCAF\u00c9 is made \n \n \n \nWhere are your products made?\nWhere are the pods manufactured?\n \n \nWhere are your products made?\n \n \n \n \nNESCAF\u00c9 products are made in various countries: Canada, USA, UK, France, Brazil, Germany, Hungary, Spain, Poland, Japan and Korea.\n\n\n \n \n \nWhere are the pods manufactured?\n \n \n \n \nAll pods are manufactured in the USA.\u00a0\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for?\n\n\nContact us through our website and we\u2019ll get back to you.

\n NESCAF\u00c9 Decaffeination Process \n \n Thursday, May 02, 2024 \n \nIf you need to advise us of a product safety or concern, click here\n \n \n All of our NESCAF\u00c9 decaf coffees are decaffeinated using only water to extract the caffeine from the coffee beans. \n\n\nWe understand the importance of offering decaffeinated coffee that meets the highest standards of quality, taste, and safety. \nThat\u2019s why all of our NESCAF\u00c9 decaf coffees are decaffeinated using only water to extract the caffeine from the coffee beans.\n\n\nWe offer a range of decaf coffees in our NESCAF\u00c9 line, including:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNESCAF\u00c9 Taster\u2019s Choice Decaf\u00a0\n\n\nNESCAF\u00c9 Rich Decaf\u00a0\n\n\nNESCAF\u00c9 Gold Espresso Decaf\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe method of using water as the decaffeination agent is known as the Swiss Water process. In opting to use water as the only decaffeination agent for our NESCAF\u00c9 coffees, we don\u2019t use any chemicals or additives in our decaffeination process, ensuring only the most natural cup of coffee is in our NESCAF\u00c9 jars.\u00a0\n\n\nWe know the importance of understanding exactly what you\u2019re consuming, so here's an overview of how we decaffeinate our NESCAF\u00c9 coffees using only water to ensure the removal of caffeine, while preserving the quality and flavour:\u00a0\n\n\n1 - Coffee beans are immersed in a flow of hot water to extract the caffeine\u00a0\n\nAll of our NESCAF\u00c9 instant coffees and decaffeinated instant coffees are made from one ingredient and one ingredient only: green coffee (the seeds of coffee cherries grown on coffee trees). Green coffee beans are immersed in a flow of hot water, expanding them, and allowing the water to penetrate the beans to extract the caffeine, since caffeine is soluble in water.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2 - The decaffeinated coffee beans are dried\u00a0\n\nOnce the caffeine has been extracted from the coffee beans using water, the coffee beans are dried using hot air that evaporates the water used in the previous process. Once the usual moisture of coffee beans is recovered, the result is a coffee bean with a fraction of the caffeine. The coffee beans retain the same properties of flavour and feel as regular coffee beans, however, a typical cup of NESCAF\u00c9 decaffeinated coffees have less than 0.3% or 5 mg of caffeine per serving, compared to between 70 \u2013 140mg in a cup of regular coffee. From this moment on, the coffee beans are ready for roasting, following the same method as regular coffee, which gives rise to NESCAF\u00c9 decaffeinated coffee.\u00a0\n\n\nBy using water to decaffeinate our NESCAF\u00c9 coffees, we\u2019re reaffirming our commitment to ensuring all of our ingredients and products meet your expectations of quality, health, and taste. Consumers who want to enjoy a cup of coffee without the caffeine, can enjoy any of our NESCAF\u00c9 decaf coffees for a rich and indulgent cup that retains the natural flavours and characteristics of regular coffee. Visit our NESCAF\u00c9 page to browse our decaf line and find it in stores near you. \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf you have additional questions regarding our decaf coffee, here are some answers to our most frequently asked questions:\u00a0\n\n\n1. Are there any health risks associated with consuming decaf coffee?\u00a0\n\n\nDecaf coffee is considered safe for consumption and does not pose significant health risks for most individuals. However, while decaf coffee contains significantly less caffeine than regular coffee, it still contains a small amount. Individuals who are highly sensitive to caffeine may still experience mild effects such as increased heart rate or sleep disturbances. It's advisable for those with caffeine sensitivity to monitor their intake and consult with a healthcare professional if necessary.\u00a0\n\n\n2. Why isn\u2019t this on the label?\u00a0\n\n\nOur decaffeination process is not mentioned on the label due to limited space constraints. The primary purpose of a product label is to provide essential information such as ingredients, nutritional facts, and potential allergens. While the decaffeination process is an important aspect of our product, it does not impact the overall composition or quality. Moreover, since NESCAF\u00c9 coffees are decaffeinated using only water, without any chemical additives, there is no need to declare water in the ingredients list or as the method of decaffeination anywhere on the label. If chemical additives were used for decaffeination, they should be declared. Rest assured, our decaffeinated products undergo rigorous testing and adhere to industry standards to ensure the removal of caffeine while maintaining taste and quality, as well as prioritizing our consumers\u2019 health. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n3. Can the decaffeination process alter the aroma or flavour profile of the coffee?\u00a0\n\n\nThe Swiss Water decaffeination process is one of the most gentle processes for removing caffeine, ensuring most of the original aroma and flavour of the coffee is preserved. However, in the process, some compounds responsible for flavour can be slightly reduced. You may find that our decaffeinated coffees are a little more mild with slightly lower acidity and bitterness. However, flavour will still vary by product due to the blend and roasting process.\u00a0\n\n\n4. Are there any additional steps taken to ensure the removal of other impurities during the decaf process?\u00a0\n\n\nBecause we use only water to decaffeinate our coffee, impurities are not introduced during the decaffeination process.\u00a0\n\n\n5. How does this method of decaffeination compare to others in terms of sustainability?\u00a0\n\n\nSwiss Water decaffeination is an eco-friendly process. It avoids the use of chemicals making it more eco-friendly than methods that rely on solvents. In addition, we use a closed-loop system in which we recycle caffeine free extract and recover water for re-use. This reduces water consumption and waste generation, making it a more sustainable process.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDid you find this answer helpful?\n \nThank you for letting us know!\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot useful\nUseful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nArticle feedback\n\n\n\n\nWebform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Select -\nI need more details\nThis article did not apply to my problem\nThis article did not solve my problem\nI need more details\n\n\nWhat was the problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can we improve this article?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note, this feedback form is used to improve articles.

It takes years of practice and experience to identify and judge a coffee\u2019s different flavours and smells correctly and consistently.\n\n\nProfessional tasters are the only way to guarantee quality and consistency. Highly trained tasters will all closely agree on the exact characteristics of any coffee they taste which is critical for delivering a consistent flavour to our customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we ensure NESCAF\u00c9 quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the harvest\n\n\nCoffee cherries are milled to get rid of the outer fruit as well as the parchment-like skin around the bean. The end result is called green coffee. Quality-control is vital at this stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the coffee is shipped\n\n\nOur network of six specialist quality-control centres make sure the coffee has been stored and handled to high standards. Professional tasters test the quality of our coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our factories\n\n\nThere are professional tasting teams in every NESCAF\u00c9 plant. Satisfying their expert taste buds is the last of many quality tests that help guarantee the fresh, delicious taste of every mug of NESCAF\u00c9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe language of coffee tasting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalking coffee\n\n\nExperts in the coffee-tasting profession use a book called the Sensory Lexicon. It\u2019s an insider\u2019s guide to the strength of the different flavours in coffee listing more than 100 different flavours. They are organised into groups such as:\n\n\nFloral, spices, sweet, cocoa\n\n\nFruity, green/vegetative\n\n\nRoasted, cereal, nutty\n\n\nEach group includes many flavours. For example, the \u201csweet\u201d group includes molasses, maple syrup, brown sugar, caramelised, honey and vanilla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudging coffee\n\n\nCoffee tasters use the Sensory Lexicon to describe subtle differences in coffee. Tasters can detect if the way the coffee was grown, milled and roasted has affected the final flavour. From the soil the tree was planted in, to the way it was watered, to the bag the beans were stored in, many factors can change flavour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the pros taste coffee\n\n\nProfessional tasters use a technique called \u201ccupping\u201d to identify the complex tastes and aromas in coffee. This includes:\n\n\nLe Nez du Caf\u00e9 Aroma. Appreciating the 36 basic scents found in coffee aroma.\n\n\nSensory skills. Judging the strength of tastes like sweet, sour and bitter.\n\n\nPeer calibration. Blind-tasting coffee so you can match the judgment of experienced tasters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom farm to cup\n\n\nCoffee tasters consider the entire coffee journey including:\n\n\nThe agriculture and science of coffee\n\n\nHow coffee is stored, milled and roasted\n\n\nHow has handling affected the final quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee Origins\nLearn more\nGrown Respectfully\nLearn more\nOur Coffee\nExplore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay connected\n\n\n\n        Follow us on our social media accounts to get even more tasty content.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.
