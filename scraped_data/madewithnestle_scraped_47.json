French meringue is beautifully contrasted by the gooey, caramel-filled ROLO Mini pieces. This easy dessert recipe combines the classic French baking techniques of the meringue, with the comfort of a traditional chocolate chip cookie.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n18\n \n30\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n NESTL\u00c9\u00ae TOLL HOUSE\u00ae Chocolate Chip Cookies \n \n \nThe NESTL\u00c9\u00ae TOLL HOUSE\u00ae Chocolate chip cookies all started in the United State in Massachusetts where Ruth Wakefield, who ran the Toll House Inn with her husband in the 1930\u2019s, cut up NESTL\u00c9 Semi-sweet chocolate bars and added them to her cookies. The chocolate bars didn\u2019t melt, they softened, and this is now the history of the chocolate chip cookie! Chocolate chip cookies are delicious and perfect for every occasion. Try this classic cookie with more than 75 years of history.  \n\n\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.

TOLL HOUSE\u00ae Chocolate chip cookies all started in the United State in Massachusetts where Ruth Wakefield, who ran the Toll House Inn with her husband in the 1930\u2019s, cut up NESTL\u00c9 Semi-sweet chocolate bars and added them to her cookies. The chocolate bars didn\u2019t melt, they softened, and this is now the history of the chocolate chip cookie! Chocolate chip cookies are delicious and perfect for every occasion. Try this classic cookie with more than 75 years of history.  \n\n\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.

Chocolate Chip Cookies \n \n \nThe NESTL\u00c9\u00ae TOLL HOUSE\u00ae Chocolate chip cookies all started in the United State in Massachusetts where Ruth Wakefield, who ran the Toll House Inn with her husband in the 1930\u2019s, cut up NESTL\u00c9 Semi-sweet chocolate bars and added them to her cookies. The chocolate bars didn\u2019t melt, they softened, and this is now the history of the chocolate chip cookie! Chocolate chip cookies are delicious and perfect for every occasion. Try this classic cookie with more than 75 years of history.  \n\n\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.

HOUSE\u00ae Chocolate Chip Cookies \n \n \nThe NESTL\u00c9\u00ae TOLL HOUSE\u00ae Chocolate chip cookies all started in the United State in Massachusetts where Ruth Wakefield, who ran the Toll House Inn with her husband in the 1930\u2019s, cut up NESTL\u00c9 Semi-sweet chocolate bars and added them to her cookies. The chocolate bars didn\u2019t melt, they softened, and this is now the history of the chocolate chip cookie! Chocolate chip cookies are delicious and perfect for every occasion. Try this classic cookie with more than 75 years of history.  \n\n\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.

Cookies \n \n \nThe NESTL\u00c9\u00ae TOLL HOUSE\u00ae Chocolate chip cookies all started in the United State in Massachusetts where Ruth Wakefield, who ran the Toll House Inn with her husband in the 1930\u2019s, cut up NESTL\u00c9 Semi-sweet chocolate bars and added them to her cookies. The chocolate bars didn\u2019t melt, they softened, and this is now the history of the chocolate chip cookie! Chocolate chip cookies are delicious and perfect for every occasion. Try this classic cookie with more than 75 years of history.  \n\n\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.

The chocolate bars didn\u2019t melt, they softened, and this is now the history of the chocolate chip cookie! Chocolate chip cookies are delicious and perfect for every occasion.

Chip Cookies \n \n \nThe NESTL\u00c9\u00ae TOLL HOUSE\u00ae Chocolate chip cookies all started in the United State in Massachusetts where Ruth Wakefield, who ran the Toll House Inn with her husband in the 1930\u2019s, cut up NESTL\u00c9 Semi-sweet chocolate bars and added them to her cookies. The chocolate bars didn\u2019t melt, they softened, and this is now the history of the chocolate chip cookie! Chocolate chip cookies are delicious and perfect for every occasion. Try this classic cookie with more than 75 years of history.  \n\n\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.

Cookies \n \n \nThe NESTL\u00c9\u00ae TOLL HOUSE\u00ae Chocolate chip cookies all started in the United State in Massachusetts where Ruth Wakefield, who ran the Toll House Inn with her husband in the 1930\u2019s, cut up NESTL\u00c9 Semi-sweet chocolate bars and added them to her cookies. The chocolate bars didn\u2019t melt, they softened, and this is now the history of the chocolate chip cookie! Chocolate chip cookies are delicious and perfect for every occasion. Try this classic cookie with more than 75 years of history.  \n\n\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.
