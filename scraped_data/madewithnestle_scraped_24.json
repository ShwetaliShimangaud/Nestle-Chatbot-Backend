Elements of Eating for Energy\n\n\n\n\nLooking for ways to have more energy? You\u2019re not alone. Many of us depend on our morning coffee to face the day and some describe ebbing energy levels by late afternoon. If you find you\u2019re feeling worn out before the day is done, consider taking a good look at your diet.\n\n\nBasics of Energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigestive Balance Its in your Nature to Thrive\n\n\n\n\nDigestive health plays an important role in our overall well-being as it affects many aspects of our health. From our ability to absorb nutrients to the strength of our immune system, a healthy digestive system is essential for maintaining general health (1). Our digestive system is so interconnected with the rest of our body even laughing with friends can improve digestion (2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport YearRound Health with Wellness Tips for Every Season\n\n\n\n\nWe have wellness tips to help you feel your best year-round, so you can look forward to welcoming whatever season comes next!\n\n\nFrom beach weather to the ski slopes, every season brings new health and wellness challenges no matter the scenery. As summer gives way to crisp autumn days, your focus might change from staying safe in hot weather to prepping for the winter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKids gummies\n\n\n\n\nVitamin Fun for Little Ones: Exploring the Benefits of Kids' Gummy Vitamins\n\n\nAs children grow, it\u2019s very important to receive the correct amount of vitamins and minerals for their optimal development and everyday wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpotlight on the Sunshine Vitamin\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDid you know that one of the largest surveys of Canadian Health (The Canadian Health Measures Survey) found that one quarter (26%) had inadequate levels, almost one in ten (8%) were considered deficient? (1). Statistics like this can help explain why vitamin D has overtaken vitamin C as the most popular supplement in Canada.\n\n\nWhat is vitamin D?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst page\n\n\n\u00ab First\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious page\n\n\n\u2039 Previous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Current page\n            \n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n5\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext page\n\n\nNext \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast page\n\n\nLast \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.

force, protecting you from intruders such as bacteria and viruses. When your immune system encounters these germs, it needs to be strong enough to stop and attack them before they can harm you or make you ill.\n\n\n\n\nLuckily, there\u2019s quite a bit we can do to help strengthen our immunity. To help support the immune system and help keep it running smoothly, it needs a regular supply of nutrients. Certain vitamins and minerals are particularly useful in aiding the immune system, helping it be more effective. For more on this, keep reading!\n\n\n\n\nHow to Help Support the Immune System\n\n\n\n\nAn overall healthy diet and lifestyle help set the stage for good immune support. Here are six tips on strategies you can get started on today:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep Hands Clean\n. \nProper handwashing\n\u202fis the single most effective way to stop the spread of germs that the immune system needs to fight off. Run hands under warm, soapy water for at least \n20 seconds \u2013 try singing a song from the 20-Second Handwashing Playlist for Good Hand Hygiene\n to time yourself\u2013 and dry them completely.\n\n\nBe\n\u202f\nphysically active\n. Moving your body not only strengthens muscles, but also helps reduce stress,\u202fwhich can \ntax the immune system\n. Plus, a very active day can lead to good sleep later, which you also need. (See the next tip below!)\n\n\nGet Plenty of Zzzs.\n Your body needs sleep to recover from the day and prepare for the day ahead. It is difficult to be at your best and fight off those foreign invaders if you\u2019re sleep deprived or if your sleep isn\u2019t particularly restful. Adults should aim for \n7-9 hours\n\u202fof good quality sleep per night.\n\n\nChill Out\n. \nBeing mentally stressed\n may also put stress on the immune system. Find ways to relax by doing activities you enjoy and that calm your mind. Meditating, writing in a journal, listening to music and cooking or baking are common ways to de-stress. And as mentioned above, exercise can also help!\n\n\nGet the Protein you Need\n. Protein is not only important to support muscle health, but this nutrient also helps create antibodies, the immune system\u2019s frontline fighters against foreign invaders. As we age, our protein needs\u202f \nincrease\n, so aim to get 20-35 grams at every meal and don\u2019t forget to include protein for snacks. Good food sources include milk, yogurt, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, nuts and beans. For a between-meal protein pick-me-up,\u202f\nBOOST\u00ae High Protein\n \u202fNutritional Drink\u202fhas 15 grams of protein per 237 ml serving. \u202f\n\n\nLook for Foods with Key Nutrients.\n Certain vitamins and\u202fminerals are important for your immune system, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n, an important antioxidant. Remember when you were little, and you were told to drink more orange juice to keep you healthy? That\u2019s because it\u2019s a great source of vitamin C. Many fruits and vegetables supply this important vitamin, so be sure to enjoy a variety.\n\n\nVitamin A\n, to help maintain a healthy immune system. You usually get vitamin A in animal foods like liver, milk and eggs; vegetable sources of beta carotene can be converted to vitamin A when needed. Dark green and orange fruits and vegetables are good sources of beta carotene and other carotenoids.\n\n\nZinc\n, which helps create immune cells and supports their proper functioning. Oysters are rich in zinc, but you can also find it in beef, poultry, beans and nuts.\n\n\nIron\n, a mineral that helps create white blood cells, which are important for fighting off infections. Meat, nuts, beans and fortified foods are great sources. (Pro tip: vitamin C helps you absorb iron from plant sources into your body, so have the two together!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne easy way to help get immune-supporting nutrients, including vitamins C and D, zinc, and iron, is to supplement your diet with a \nBOOST\u00ae Nutritional Drink\n. BOOST\u00ae\u202fproducts contain protein, vitamins and minerals, including these key nutrients \u2013 just look for the Immune Support call-out on the label.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBack to top\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 Foods that Give You Energy\n \n \n \nBrand\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExploring Heart Health & Omega-3 Supplements Beyond Fish Oil \n \n \n \nNutrition\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNestl\u00e9 Canada\u2019s Nesquik proudly sponsors the First-Ever National Make Happy Tummies Campaign \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPay Attention to Protein at Breakfast \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 Elements of Eating for Energy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDigestive Balance: It\u2019s in your Nature to Thrive\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKids  gummies\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpotlight on the Sunshine Vitamin\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 Foods that Give You Energy\n \n \n \nBrand\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExploring Heart Health & Omega-3 Supplements Beyond Fish Oil \n \n \n \nNutrition\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNestl\u00e9 Canada\u2019s Nesquik proudly sponsors the First-Ever National Make Happy Tummies Campaign \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPay Attention to Protein at Breakfast \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 Elements of Eating for Energy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDigestive Balance: It\u2019s in your Nature to Thrive\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKids  gummies\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpotlight on the Sunshine Vitamin\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\u2713\nThanks for sharing!\nFind any service\nAddToAny\nMore\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.

children grow, it\u2019s very important to receive the correct amount of vitamins and minerals for their optimal development and everyday wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\nIdeally children would get most of the nutrients they require from the diet. However, many kids do not always make the most nutritious food choices and up to 50% of children are fussy eaters. This can limit the intake of foods such as fruit and vegetables which are the richest sources of vitamin C.1\n\n\n\n\nVitamin D, the \u201csunshine vitamin\u201d is only found in the diet in small amounts and we rely on exposure to sunlight as our main source. It\u2019s important to protect our children\u2019s skin from the sun\u2019s UV rays and be out of the sun during hot weather. Staying out of the sun and the use of sunscreen decrease the amount of vitamin D we produce.\n\n\n\n\nBone & Muscle Health\n\n\n\n\nVitamin D\n is important for the growth, development and maintenance of healthy bones and teeth by helping our children\u2019s bodies absorb the mineral calcium.2-5\n\n\n\n\nImmune Health\n\n\n\n\nA well-functioning immune system is vital for good health. As kids' immune systems develop it\u2019s important to support it with the right nutrients\n\n\n\n\nIt takes around 8 years for a child\u2019s immune system to fully develop during which time they are more prone infections. Vitamin D helps support the normal function of the immune system in children.6\n\n\n\n\nKeeping Vitamin D Topped Up\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Safe sun exposure between the hours of 11:00 and 15:00 \u2022 Consume oily fish, eggs and mushrooms enriched with vitamin D and fortified foods \u2022 Take a supplement\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin and cannot be made by the body so it is essential to obtain it daily from your diet.7\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining Immune Function8\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C is required for the function of white blood cells involved in protecting the body against infections and foreign invaders.8,9\n\n\n\n\nWhen the immune system is under attack increased production of free radicals can damage the body\u2019s cells.10 Vitamin C helps protect cells against oxidative stress.11\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Collagen12\n\n\n\n\nCollagen production is vital for growing bodies and vitamin C helps in the production of collagen which supports healthy cartilage, bones, gums and teeth.12\n\n\n\n\nVitamin A\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Vitamin A support healthy immune function and contributes to normal vision 13,14\n\n\n\n\nB Vitamins\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Vitamin B6 and B12 support energy production, reduce tiredness and fatigue and support psychological and nervous system function 21,22 metabolism and helps to form red blood cells. 15,16\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Vitamin B3 support energy metabolism. 15,16\n\n\n\n\nSupplementing with a daily multivitamin can help to ensure children have an adequate nutrient intake alongside a healthy, balanced diet.
