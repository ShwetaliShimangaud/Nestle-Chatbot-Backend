help you add heart-healthy Omega-3 to your diet even when fish oil is off the table.\n\n\n\n\nFish oil is a great way to add more Omega-3 to your diet and support cardiovascular health.* But maybe you\u2019re allergic, vegetarian or vegan, or simply don\u2019t like fish oil supplements. Don\u2019t worry\u2014we\u2019re kicking off Heart Month with ideas to help you add heart-healthy Omega-3 to your diet even when fish oil is off the table.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Are Omega-3 Fatty Acids?\n\n\n\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids are considered \u201cgood\u201d fats that are important for cardiovascular, metabolic and cellular health.* They are beneficial for the maintenance of your cells and several body systems and organs, including your heart, joints, brain and eyes.* Because your body does not produce Omega-3 on its own, it\u2019s important to get these fatty acids as part of a balanced diet.\n\n\n\n\nThe three main Omega-3 fatty acids include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlpha-linolenic acid (ALA)\n\n\nEicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)\n\n\nDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile EPA and DHA are typically found in fish and other kinds of seafood, you can also get EPA & DHA as well as ALA from certain plant-based sources such as Algae and supplements.\n\n\n\n\nSources of Omega-3 Fatty Acids Besides Fish Oil\n\n\n\n\nMany foods other than fish and fish oil contain Omega-3, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlaxseed oil\n\n\nFlaxseeds\n\n\nChia seeds\n\n\nWalnuts\n\n\nCanola oil\n\n\nSoybean oil\n\n\nEdamame\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with adding foods containing Omega-3\u2019s to your diet, you could take supplements containing these important fatty acids. Nature\u2019s Bounty\u00ae Flaxseed Oil Softgels contain 540 mg of Omega-3 per serving to support heart health and cellular energy.* Flaxseed oil is a premium source of the Omega-3 fatty acid ALA.\n\n\n\n\nFish Oil Supplements for People Who Don\u2019t Like Fish Oil\n\n\n\n\nLooking for an option that has the benefits of fish oil but doesn\u2019t taste like fish oil? Nature\u2019s Bounty\u00ae has you covered with a variety of fish oil supplements designed to minimize that dreaded fishy aftertaste.\n\n\n\n\nTry Nature\u2019s Bounty\u00ae Omega-3 Softgels, which contain the heart-healthy Omega-3s DHA and EPA from fish oil.* These grape, strawberry and raspberry flavored gummies are so delicious, you\u2019ll look forward to making them part of your daily routine.\n\n\n\n\nOur Mini Fish Oil softgels are another great option, delivering 900 mg of Omega-3 per serving. Each softgel is coated, which means the active ingredients bypass the stomach and are digested in the small intestine, helping you avoid unpleasant \u201cfish burps.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nOther Must-Have Heart Health Supplements\n\n\n\n\nGetting enough Omega-3s is just one way to support heart health.* Along with a healthy diet, exercise, and other lifestyle changes, you can choose from a variety of other heart health supplements to support your ticker.* Two great options include:\n\n\n\n\nBerberine. Berberine is an herbal supplement that comes from a compound found in the bark of the Berberine plant. Used for centuries, Berberine supports cardiovascular health and helps maintain healthy cholesterol, triglyceride and blood sugar levels already within the normal range.* Try Nature\u2019s Bounty\u00ae Berberine, a heart, blood sugar and cardiovascular health support supplement delivering 1000 mg of Berberine per serving.*\n\n\n\n\nCo Q-10. Coenzyme Q-10 (Co Q-10) is a nutrient that functions as an important antioxidant and provides cardiovascular support.* Nature\u2019s Bounty\u00ae offers a variety of Co Q-10 products, including Co Q-10 200 mg, rapid release softgels that support heart health and cellular energy production.* If you prefer gummy vitamins, our Co-Q-10 gummies also contain 200 mg of Co Q-10 per serving\u2014and you\u2019ll love the delicious mango flavor.\n\n\n\n\nPutting Heart Health First\n\n\n\n\nWhile fish oil may be a great option for supporting cardiovascular health, there are many other ways to get Omega-3 and other heart-healthy ingredients.* What matters is finding the heart health routine that works for you\u2014and American Heart Month is the perfect time to get started!\n\n\n\n\nNature\u2019s Bounty\u00ae is here to support your cardiovascular wellness in February and all year round.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBack to top\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 Foods that Give You Energy\n \n \n \nBrand\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNestl\u00e9 Canada\u2019s Nesquik proudly sponsors the First-Ever National Make Happy Tummies Campaign \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPay Attention to Protein at Breakfast \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 Elements of Eating for Energy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDigestive Balance: It\u2019s in your Nature to Thrive\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKids  gummies\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpotlight on the Sunshine Vitamin\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSupport Year-Round Health with Wellness Tips for Every Season\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 Foods that Give You Energy\n \n \n \nBrand\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNestl\u00e9 Canada\u2019s Nesquik proudly sponsors the First-Ever National Make Happy Tummies Campaign \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPay Attention to Protein at Breakfast \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 Elements of Eating for Energy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDigestive Balance: It\u2019s in your Nature to Thrive\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKids  gummies\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpotlight on the Sunshine Vitamin\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSupport Year-Round Health with Wellness Tips for Every Season\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\u2713\nThanks for sharing!\nFind any service\nAddToAny\nMore\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.

get-togethers. We need plenty of energy to do all the things we love!\n\n\n\n\nThere are bound to be days when we feel like we could use more energy. Maybe we didn\u2019t sleep well the night before, or we\u2019re coming down with a cold. Or it could be because of what we\u2019ve been eating and drinking.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNutrition to Fuel Your Body\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is it that gives us energy? Of course, we know that caffeinated beverages and shots provide the feeling of quick energy, but what we really need is sustained energy \u2013 that is, energy from foods that fuel the cells of the body and keep us going strong. \u00a0Specific nutrients to focus on include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrates\n, which can give you quick energy (think: sugar) or long-lasting energy (whole grains and fiber-rich foods). \u00a0\n\n\nFat,\n which provides slower-burning energy. \u00a0\n\n\nB vitamins\n that help unlock the energy potential of carbohydrates, fat and protein \u00a0\n\n\nProtein,\n to provide building blocks for your muscles and other tissues, help keep your body working well and for sustained energy - just to name a few of its functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Nutrient-packed Foods to Help Fuel Nutritional Energy\n\nKnowing the nutrients that contribute to energy levels is great, but how does this translate to the actual foods we eat? Here\u2019s a list of what you can keep on hand to help deliver those energy-fueling nutrients:\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. \nBananas \n\u2013 If you\u2019ve ever been to a road race, you know that bananas are a runner\u2019s favourite food, both for pre-workout and recovery. That\u2019s because bananas have a good mix of starch (slow-burning carbs) and sugar (quick-burning carbs). Bananas are also a source of vitamin B6, potassium and vitamin C.\n\n2.\n Pasta\n \u2013 Another favourite dish of athletes, pasta provides complex, starchy carbohydrates to give you sustainable energy plus fibre if you select whole grain choices. You\u2019ll also get a variety of B vitamins and iron.\n\n3.\u00a0\n Avocados\n \u2013 These green fruits (yes, they\u2019re a fruit!) provide healthy fats and fibre, as well as pantothenic acid, a B vitamin that helps convert food to energy.\u00a0\n\n4\n. Nuts \n\u2013 When it comes to protein, carbs and fat, nuts have it all. The fat in nuts is unsaturated, meaning it\u2019s more heart-healthy. You also get a good amount of fiber, B vitamins, iron and magnesium.\n\n5. \nSalmon\n \u2013 Fish is a great source of protein, and salmon especially provides heart-healthy omega-3 fats and vitamins B3 (niacin), B6 and B12.\u00a0\n\n6.\n Yogurt\n \u2013 Yogurt is made by fermenting milk using healthy bacteria to give it a versatile, thicker texture. Dairy-based yogurt is an excellent source of protein, vitamins B2 (riboflavin) and B12, and a good source of magnesium.\n\n7. \nBreakfast cereal\n \u2013 Ready-to-eat cereal has been a staple at breakfast for generations, probably because it is a convenient way to get you going for the day. Grains such as wheat, rice or corn tend to serve as the main ingredient in cereal, so you get energy-enhancing carbohydrates. Choosing whole-grain and lower-sugar cereal options will help keep your energy levels steady. Most breakfast cereal is also fortified with iron, B vitamins, magnesium and other nutrients.\u00a0\n\n8. \nOatmeal\n \u2013 Oats are a great way to start the day. They\u2019re a naturally good source of carbohydrates and fiber, and they\u2019re loaded with B vitamins like thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), B6, and folate (B9). Have you ever thought of preparing them as a savoury dish? Oats are a great base for additions like eggs, cheese, kimchi, curry, chili \u2013 the sky is the limit!
