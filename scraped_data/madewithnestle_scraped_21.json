Roast\n\n\n\n\nEvery espresso beverage we handcraft for you started right here. The quest began in 1975 with a search for the perfect melding of beans and roast, ending months of intense experimentation later with the coffee you\u2019re holding in your hand. A recipe for caramelly sweetness\u2014so right it\u2019s never been changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarbucks Nespresso Blonde Espresso Roast\n\n\n\n\nNearly five decades of sourcing, blending and roasting brought us here: a second espresso that\u2019s boldly mellow. This special blend of beans from Latin America was carefully roasted to coax out sweet, vibrant notes. Soft and balanced, it pairs well with milk, making classic espresso drinks extra smooth without a roasty edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarbucks Nespresso Pike Place\n\n\n\n\nFrom our first store in Seattle's Pike Place Market to our coffeehouses around the world, customers requested a freshly brewed coffee they could enjoy throughout the day. A smooth, well-rounded blend of Latin American coffees with subtly rich flavors of chocolate and toasted nuts, it's served fresh every day at a Starbucks\u00ae store near you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst page\n\n\n\u00ab First\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious page\n\n\n\u2039 Previous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Current page\n            \n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n54\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext page\n\n\nNext \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast page\n\n\nLast \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.
