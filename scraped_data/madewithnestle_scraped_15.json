Cooked on a Middle Eastern shawarma\u2013style spit called a trompo, this recipe \u2014 spiked with chiles, adobo sauce and orange juice, and topped with pineapple and cilantro \u2014 has been adapted to be easily created in your own kitchen \u2013 no trompo required.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality Street Khajoor Cake\n\n\n\n            \n            \n            \n            Perfect for Iftar, this cake is rich with dates that restore energy after a day of fasting.

This easy dessert recipe combines the classic French baking techniques of the meringue, with the comfort of a traditional chocolate chip cookie.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNescaf\u00e9 Leche Flan\n\n\n\n            \n            \n            \n            Leche Flan is a beloved Filipino dessert, but we're putting a twist on the traditional recipe by adding Nescaf\u00e9 Rich Instant Coffee. This decadent caramel custard recipe only requires a few simple ingredients and is perfect for any family celebration.\n\nUse any kind of Nescaf\u00e9 instant coffee or espresso that you have on hand.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRASPBERRY BROWN BUTTER CR\u00caPES \u00c0 LA MODE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst page\n\n\n\u00ab First\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious page\n\n\n\u2039 Previous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n185\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Current page\n            \n186\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n187\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Page\n            \n188\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext page\n\n\nNext \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast page\n\n\nLast \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSite Map\n \nTerms\n \nPrivacy Policy\n \nCookie Policy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur site uses cookies and other technologies so that we, and our partners, can remember you and understand how you use our site.
