Chingri-Malai Curry! \u2018Chingri\u2019 means prawn and \u2018Malai\u2019 means cream, but it\u2019s the coconut milk in this recipe that gives it the creaminess and smooth texture.

conversation about traditional Bengali cuisine can never be complete without Chingri-Malai Curry! \u2018Chingri\u2019 means prawn and \u2018Malai\u2019 means cream, but it\u2019s the coconut milk in this recipe that gives it the creaminess and smooth texture. So, if you love seafood and are in the mood to have something delicious, this is a recipe you need to try!\n\n\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.
