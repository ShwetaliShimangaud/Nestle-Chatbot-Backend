\n \n \nThe NESTL\u00c9\u00ae TOLL HOUSE\u00ae Chocolate chip cookies all started in the United State in Massachusetts where Ruth Wakefield, who ran the Toll House Inn with her husband in the 1930\u2019s, cut up NESTL\u00c9 Semi-sweet chocolate bars and added them to her cookies. The chocolate bars didn\u2019t melt, they softened, and this is now the history of the chocolate chip cookie! Chocolate chip cookies are delicious and perfect for every occasion. Try this classic cookie with more than 75 years of history.  \n\n\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada.

           \n\n              Tweet\n            \n\n              Email\n            \n\n              Pin\n            \n\n            Print\n          \n \n \nA Festival of Love and Lights \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDiwali is a vibrant and colourful celebration that\u2019s all about light, delicious food, togetherness and exchanging heartfelt gifts. One treat that you\u2019ve probably indulged in during Diwali is Nankhatai. This year, we\u2019re putting a fun twist on Nankhatai cookies. We\u2019re combining the classic Nankhatai recipe, with its buttery and melt-in-your-mouth texture, with Quality Street sweets for the best of both worlds.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe Season for Giving \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNankhatai is more than just a cookie, it\u2019s a symbol of the love and warmth you share with your family and friends during Diwali. During the festive season, you\u2019re probably used to preparing and giving delicious treats as a symbol of good wishes. This year, you can start a new tradition with the addition of Quality Street chocolates and caramels. You\u2019ll get rave reviews from your loved ones as they savour these cookies, making your Diwali celebrations truly memorable. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBlending Two Family Traditions\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nQuality Street sweets have long been a traditional holiday treat for families around the world. That\u2019s why we decided to combine two family traditions in one with this festive recipe. As you bake Quality Street Nankhatai cookies, your home will be filled with an irresistible aroma that captures the essence of Diwali. The burst of flavours from these iconic chocolates makes these cookies a true fusion of tradition and sweetness. Combining the traditional Nankhatai recipe and the delicious Quality Street sweets will surely create a symphony of flavours in every bite. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe Personal Touch of Homemade Treats\u202f\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nQuality Street sweets make these Nankhatai cookies one-of-a-kind, since no two will taste the same. With the wide range of flavours available in each Quality Street tin, you can make the perfect bite for anyone. If your family has a favourite chocolate or caramel, you can make custom Nankhatai cookies with certain flavours. How about a coconut Nankhatai? Or one that\u2019s made exclusively with caramels? Orange Nankhatai cookies would be delightful too! The options are endless.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGifts Wrapped with Love \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThere's something truly special about homemade gifts, especially when it comes to Diwali. It\u2019s a tradition to exchange extravagantly decorated boxes of mithai during the festive season, and the limited-edition Quality Street tin is the perfect gift that can be reused after the chocolates and caramels are gone. The time and care spent baking these cookies and delivering them in a personalized tin will be a heartfelt gesture that your friends and family are sure to appreciate. And by giving Quality Street Nankhatai cookies, you're not just giving a delicious treat but also a little bit of homemade love.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDiwali Celebration with A World of Flavours\u202f\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nQuality Street Nankhatai \ncookies aren\u2019t the only treats we\u2019re cooking up for Diwali and the holiday season. We\u2019re sharing loads of simple recipes on our website that you can serve your friends and family to celebrate the beginning of the Hindu New Year. Ready to spread joy and sweetness this Diwali?

flour or gram flour), sugar, and ghee. The secret of these irresistible sweet balls full of flavor lies in the careful preparation of the right ingredients. Besan laddoos are often served during religious festivals. Try them for Diwali!\n\n\n\nSome of the products used in these recipes are not available for purchase Canada. Therefore we encourage you wherever possible to find local alternative products.
