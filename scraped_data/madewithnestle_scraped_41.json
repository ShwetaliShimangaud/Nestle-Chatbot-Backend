You can do this by placing the bowl over hot water on the stove, stirring until chocolate is completely melted.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n2\n \nFilling the Mold\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the chocolate has melted, carefully scoop a teaspoon at a time into the mold. Make sure to fill each cavity of the mold evenly.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n3\n \nChill in Fridge\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPlace the mold in the fridge to allow the chocolate to set and harden. This should take approximately 5 minutes to cool off.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n4\n \nRemove chocolate from mold\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter the chocolate has hardened, take the mold out of the fridge. Gently pop the chocolate out of the mold, being careful not to break it.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n5\n \nFilling the Chocolate Sphere\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTake one half of the chocolate sphere and fill it with mini marshmallows, 25g of Carnation Hot chocolate, and 1 teaspoon of your favourite Nescaf\u00e9 instant coffee.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n6\n \n Melting and Binding Chocolate\n \n \n \n \n \n \nHeat up a frying pan and once hot, place an empty hemisphere on top with the dome side up. Once it begins to melt, remove and connect to the filled hemisphere. The melted chocolate will allow the two hemispheres to bind.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n7\n \nBrush with Chocolate\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTake the remainder of melted hot chocolate and with a small brush go over the lining where the hemispheres connect to make sure it's fully connected.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n8\n \n Decorate Chocolate Sphere\n \n \n \n \n \n \nLet your creativity shine!
